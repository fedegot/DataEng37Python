# Test Driven Development
#
# 1 - Write the test (it will fail)
# 2 - Write the code need to make the test pass
# 3 - Refactor your code
#
# REPEAT
#
# - You have a suite of tests
# - You kown your code works
# - You code better
#     - Thinking about input and outputs
#     - It's lean - you're only doing what's needed
#     - You deliver code that is testable
